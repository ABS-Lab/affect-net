Welcome to AffectNet, the first comprehensive citation network map of the affective science literature. AffectNet is based on a citation network and content analysis of over 100,000 papers and over one million citation links. It serves as a supplement to Iancarelli et al. (submitted), which identified citation-based communities in the field, their main contents, most central papers, links to other communities, and potential missed connections. Users can explore the 69 community profiles identified in this work on the "All profiles" page.

This project was supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences, Grant #2241938.
